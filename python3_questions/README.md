### How does it work ?
Mini python applications.
- duplicates.py -> Finds duplicate items in the series and prints.
- parenthesis.py -> check if parentheses are opened/closed correctly.
- async.py -> Prints every item in the series at 1, 2, 4, 8-second intervals
              (time & array hardcoded)

#### Usage

```
python3 <FILE_NAME> (python3.5 used)
```
